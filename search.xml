    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Many we times we want dockers to keep running when started, either through docker-compose or kubernetes The following are a few of the command we can use to achieve the same: sleep inf tail -F /dev/null These commands need to run as the first thing that these dockers run. So they go as the entrypoint. Or if you want flexiblity you can add them as command, but ensure that the entrypoint know how to run these. These can also be passed directly to the docker run command, and later you can start a bash terminal using docker exec (instead of starting bash/sh in docker run and the using docker attach)]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Tooling Update]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2017%2Ftooling-update%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[While going over different technologies that could be used to augment the existing stack in GMETRI (more about that to be written) I came across a number of exciting advancements that occurred in the JS world over the last one and a half year. Focusing on creating a startup and with me becoming a father (for the first time) left me with little time to keep up with the latest tech happenings. This post is an attempt to overcome that. Motivation While trying to interpret the nagging feeling that something was missing in the way we developed, I went down to my roots. Why do I think I can code well? This reminded me what some of my most complex and well written pieces of code were — Games. Games traditionally are the most difficult (and exciting) pieces of code to write because both the background complexity and the UI are an order of magnitude more complex than the usual day to day apps we are used to. GoalOn a personal front am planning to create a simple game to give me a taste of the below tools and frameworks that seem to be missing pieces using this article as a guide. Hopefully yields a good result! ReactNative looks like a good platform to be building it. Also with ReactVR gaining popularity it makes the argument to learn ReactNative and basing all (near term) future development on ReactJS even stronger. Treasure HuntOn the tooling front a search on React yielded a gold mine. This article is an opinionated piece on every new building block that I was searching for. Also a very interesting piece of information was that Angular 4 is something that can be seriously looked at for future projects. The only fear is the cost of context switching. Pieces Missing in our current flow — Solution Type Checking — Flow State Manager — MobX Material Design for React — React Toolbox Form validations — FormState API Layer: GraphQL Frontend API Caching Layer: apollo-client Type Checking: Flow/TypeScript 2 (Good comparison) The above is list that will undergo serious changes once the test game is complete. More on that in another post.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2017%2Fresearching-png-resizing%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A lot has been written about resizing PNGs and the comparison of different tools that allow it. The following are my top picks: pngquant - fastest of the lot. Also has a node interface optipng - Changes PNG compression algo pngnq - Reduces the colorspace used by the PNG image If not using pngquant, the best result is by first using pngnq to reduce colorspace, and then using optipng to compress it further. ToDoI want to integrate with the current PNG resizer into a on the fly url based resizer. We currently use image resizer which is internally based on sharp. The problem with sharp is that it doesn’t work well with PNGs quality reduction. Found a very customizable resizer that can probably integrated with pngquant for on the fly PNG quality reduction.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2017%2Fswitching-from-hexo-to-hugo%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[My first hugo blog post. Crazy time trying to figure out differences sections, types and layouts. Finally the dust settles, with a few compromises. TODOs Need to add tags apart from just categories in the template. A nice challenge! [X] Need to figure out shortcodes for youtube and fontawesome. (About us page dependent on that) [X] To figure out how to publish to sahil.cc (to a separate github repo to allow https) [X] Using image in Hugo [X] Deciding folder and URL structure of posts [X] Finalize default archetype [X] Galleries in Hugo (https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery) [X] Copy all posts [X] Fix all posts [X] Copy all drafts [X] Fix disqus comments in theme (TODO: postback a pull request to fix in main theme) [X] Fix all drafts [X] Move remaining blogs from here [X] Post in all old blogs that the new blog is now sahil.cc. List here [X] https://sahilahuja.wordpress.com/ [X] An outdated (b)log [X] Net smart @ NITT!! [X] Gud4Nothin [X] PC Based Oscilloscope [X] Pragyan Development [X] Pragyan ‘08 - All applicable posts Is there God? - NA, no posts And the move is officially done! LearningsCategorization:Categorization of posts in happen through two concepts: Sections:The 1st level folder under which a post is created in the folder “content” is the section of that post. Type = Section by default. The type can overridden through Front Matter. Sections can’t be overridden. Taxonomies:Taxonomies are user defined groupings of content. Taxonomies have to be defined in the config file except for tags and categories which exist by default. Section Structure:There are ways to disconnect the folder structure from the URL structure in Hugo. Per post this can be accomplished through front matter named url and on a website level the following config achieves the same:12[permalinks] post = &quot;/:year/:month/:title/&quot; However fatigue prevailed and I decided to go for a structure where there is balance between the number of brain cycles that get extinguished trying to decide where every new post needs to placed and the logical structure of posts on the website. This middle ground was the decision to use only the year in the URL. This allows one to achieve the minimum level of segregation required at the filesystem layer, prevents the URL from looking really bad and also informs the user if the post being read is too old (going for month in this case is an overkill). This also allows for zero manipulation of the path to url conversion. Creating new posts:See archetypes. Command:1hugo new &lt;content-section&gt;/&lt;file-name.md&gt; Eg: `hugo new post/2017/switching-from-hexo-to-hugo.md`]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2017%2Ftyping-unicode-characters-in-ubuntu%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Ever since I decided that &#96; was the best means to toggle Yakuake (which has been my lifeline for an integral part of the way I work for a long time now), typing &#96; whenever I needed it has been hell.After going through a great deal and self doubt, the final outcome deserves being documented. The way to type a backtick without using the backtick key is through its unicode. The following are the ways to type unicode: For General UseShift + Ctrol + U follow by the unicode and a space or enter.Eg: Shift + Ctrol + U 0060 enter converts to a ```12345678*Reference:* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GtkComposeTable ### In WebstormUnfortunately the above methods don&apos;t work in Jetbrain IDEs. There&apos;s a great Jetbrains plugin to solve this problem: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/2162-string-manipulationAfter installing this plugin, type `\u0060`, select it, and then `Alt + M`, `1`, `D` to convert it to ``` ` In EmacsC-x 8 followed by either the Unicode code point or the Unicode name of the character. For example, C-x 8 RET degree cel TAB completes to DEGREE CELSIUS and inserts ℃. Important unicode characters: Name Unicode Character Name for Emacs Backtick 0060 ` GRAVE ACCENT Degrees 00b0 ° DEGREE SIGN Tick 2714 ✔ HEAVY CHECK MARK Wrong 2715 ✕ MULTIPLICATION X]]></content>

My Convolution:To learn algorithms, I started a Coursera course, to run examples of which I needed a Java Project setup locally, in which I needed to input stuff, for which I needed a testing framework, hence I tried to find the best testing framework, and found out about Spock and also needed a project dependency manager like Maven/Ant/Gradle, and chose Gradle as the dependency manager of choice, and learnt Groovy to be able to write Gradle DSL. For a moment I thought Rube Goldberg was sitting next to me. All I wanted was to learn Algorithms.

    <title><![CDATA[Issues while renewing Passport - the JS one]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2016%2FIssues-while-renewing-Passport-the-JS-one%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[No, am not talking about my actual passport, which also needs to be renewed soon by the way. Am talking about PassportJS. Continuing my rant over the not so good login infrastructure avaible - the following were the gotchas we faced while implementing passportjs: Passport requires a callbackURL when initialzing it. Thanks to https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-facebook/issues/2 we found out it could also be specified while calling the strategy. Passport assumes the developer will do most of the route wiring. A very important prerequisite is the flow of control in it’s documentation. Hint - it’s not there. Found a great blog post detailing the same: http://toon.io/understanding-passportjs-authentication-flow/ A much hidden pattern in Passport is the verification of the access_token itself. After much hue and cry, found it to be the following: Google: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=${user.access_token} Facebook: https://graph.facebook.com/debug_token?access_token=${fb_app_id}|${fb_app_secret}&amp;input_token=${user.access_token}When a request is made to the above URLs, a response code of 200 signifies that the token is valid. And now for the cool features of Passport that weren’t that obvious at first: Normalized profiles: When authenticating using a third-party service such as Facebook or Twitter, user profile information is often available. Each service tends to have a different way of encoding this information. To make integration easier, Passport normalizes profile information. Probably not the place for this, but express supports callback chaining. So potentially before the final route callback we can put many as many authentication/authorization callbacks as we want. Eg: 123456router.get( '/authenticated/route/', (req, res, next)=&gt;&#123;doAuthentication(); next();&#125;, (req, res, next)=&gt;&#123;doAuthorization(); next();&#125;, (req, res, next)=&gt;&#123;res.render(page);&#125;,); which is what passport.authenticate is - one of these callbacks]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2016%2FJWT-JSON-Web-Token-Passing-on-the-secret-without-letting-the-neighours-know%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Login is still a tough problem! It’s been 5 years since I left coding professionally and still parts of this remain unresolved. Hello JWTDuring my search for a good encrytion system to store user secrets, I came across something very cool - JWT - reminds me of the RSA public/private key encription system - only modified to be much more user friendly for web/mobile development. JWT creates a token that can be decrypted only by person having a secret key using which it was encrypted. As long the website stores JWT in it’s cookie, the server can decrypt the cookie every time and trust the decrypted content. This allows us to store sensitive information like user id and user permissions in the cookie. This is a stateless authentication mechanism as the user state is never saved in server memory. The server’s protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header, and if it’s present, the user will be allowed to access protected resources. As JWTs are self-contained, all the necessary information is there, reducing the need to query the database multiple times. Structure of a JWT tokenJSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are: Header, Payload, Signature Header: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. Payload: Contains the claims. There are three types of claims: reserved, public, and private Reserved claims: Set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), and others. Public claims: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. Private claims: These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them. Example payload:12345&#123; &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;1234567890&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;: true&#125; Signature: Take the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret, the algorith specified in header and sign thatHMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + &quot;.&quot; + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret) For more details: https://jwt.io/]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Creating a super-pendrive]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2009%2Fcreating-a-super-pendrive%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi, Its been really long since I blogged. Before going ahead, want to tell you that will be posting my endeavours on running virtual machines soon. This, however, is my experience/guide for creating a super pen drive (a.k.a. a usb disk that if booted from presents a grub menu with options - GParted, Fedora, .. and any other linux distro hopefully, and has Fedora persistence, and has a spare partition too for you to use it as a normal pen drive). It wasn’t as straight forward as I thought (like… all other things). Steps: Decide the partitioning layout and partition the pen drive. Install grub on one partition Install GParted on another Install Fedora on another Install grub again on the partition in step 2 :P, and setup grub.conf Sit back, and enjoy (may need to crouch forward in some cases.. )A super neat trick: To check at any time how you pen drive would behave if you boot from it, use the command : qemu -hda /dev/sdb -m 256 -vga std This command reduced my research time to one third. 1) Decide the partitioning layout I used GParted on my Fedora installation (on my harddisk) to set up the partition of the pen drive. 2) Install grub on one partition Make sure you manually mount the grub partition. The /media/something folder in which it gets mounted automatically gave me some trouble. So unmounted it from there, and mounted /dev/sdb5 to /mnt/usbgrub grub-install --no-floppy --root-directory=/mnt/usbgrub/ /dev/sdb 3) Install GParted on another Use UNetbootin for GParted 4) Install Fedora on another Need to make sure that usb disk is ext3 before doing this. When I did this on a vfat disk, I got an “error 22” when trying to boot from the usb disk. Use liveusb-creator or live-iso-to-disk for Fedora. Persistence is buggy according to http://forums.fedoraforum.org/archive/index.php/t-219250.html so instead, a better solution is to directly install fedora on the pen drive on a separate partition, like in http://linuxsoftwareblog.com/blog/?p=156 5) Install grub again on the partition in step 2 :P, and setup grub.conf123456mount /dev/sdb5 /mnt/usbgrub/grub-install --no-floppy --root-directory=usbgrub/ /dev/sdbNow, to setup the grub menu:cd /mnt/usbgrub/boot/grub/cp /boot/grub/grub.conf .cp /boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz . gedit grub.conf123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627# grub.conf generated by anaconda## Note that you do not have to rerun grub after making changes to this file# NOTICE: You have a /boot partition.

    <title><![CDATA[Digikam Caveats - things to make sure using Digikam]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2009%2Fdigikam-caveats-things-to-make-sure-using-digikam%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I have been bitten. And so I post this in the hope that some needy soul finds this before he/she/it gets bitten too. Problem: Digikam saves image tags (ratings/captions that you spend hours editing) in its internal database. When you switch to a newer linux version, lose this information - unless you are careful enough to copy over the digikam.db4 file - which I was. The second problem is that if you move around or copy your files using a file browser, you lose this information ( !!!! ), and digikam doesn’t allow copy of albums (!!). Solution: Specify the location of your digikam.db4 file as the root directory of you photo library. This way, when you move your library, you have the digikam database with you.This can be configured through digikam Configuration &gt; Collections. The most important step (which digikam should have made default according to the Principle of least astonishment) Enable the all options starting with “Save” in digikam Configuration &gt; Metadata. This would save all tags, ratings, captions and copyright information directly in the image instead of relying on digikam database for it. Add author and copyright information in digikam Configuration &gt; Identity. I put the following there: Author: Sahil Ahuja Credit: Sahil Ahuja Source: http://sahilahuja.wordpress.com Copyright: CC BY 3.0These steps will ensure that from now on all you files get properly tagged, the way you mean them to be.What about the images I have already tagged, captioned and rated? After these setting are applied, digikam enforces them only for images you write to from now onwards. For images that are already in your library, we need a write operation on them to embed the metadata into the files. This can can be done by creating a custom search that matches all possible ratings one by one, and right clicking and assigning the same rating again. Do the same for all tags too. And now all your metadata should get embedded in the file. Voila!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Giving httpd access to other folders (apart from default SElinux allowed folders): system-config-selinux rocks!!Go to System-&gt; Administration -&gt; SELinux Management (or system-config-selinux from command line).Type httpd in Filter and press enter. You will see that files that allow httpd write access have the Selinux File Type httpd_cache_t:s0. So.. now you know what to do right? Say you want to give httpd write access to folder /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache, then add a new file labelling using the Add button with the following details:File specifications: /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache(/.*)? File Type: all files SELinux Type: httpd_cache_t MLS: s0and thenrestorecon /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache OR Go to /var/lib/dokuwiki/data and apply the selinux file type to cache directorychcon -R -t httpd_cache_t /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cacheAnd now, httpd should have write access to this folder.Running httpd on other ports:Open /etc/httpd/http.conf and changeListen 80toListen 81 If you use VirtualHosts, you need to change the ports there instead (&lt;VirtualHost *:81&gt;)Giving httpd access to other ports:Go to Network Port in SELinux Administration and filter of “80” and press enter. You will see an entry for http_port_t. Create a similar new entry for port 81 for SELinux Port type http_port_1.And that’s it.Links to posts that helped me:Dan Walsh’s Blog Notes on SElinux]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Making Fedora rpms/yum work - Offline]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2009%2Fmaking-fedora-work-offline%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is guide relevant to those who wish to spread fedora to friends and loved ones who don’t necessarily always have an internet connection (or a good one atleast). The problem faced in such situations, almost always (talking from my experience), is that there are a huge number of rpms that need to be downloaded to make fedora capable of playing media, and fill it with good stuff like k3b, amarok etc. This isn’t always possible with the skimpy internet connections that our not-so-tech-savvy aunts have. (We’ll assume that it is our aunt on whose system we need to install fedora for the sake of this guide.) So, I devised a way of spreading fedora to our aunt’s system, without getting embarrassed by that fact that we weren’t able to run mp3 on their system. The way to do this, is to install a fresh copy of fedora on our system, and then bring it to perfect shape by installing many more rpms, and while doing this, keeping a copy of the rpms required, and then copying this repository of rpms (which we are sure don’t require any more rpms as dependencies as we install them on our own system in offline mode) on a pen drive and taking it along with the fedora installation media to our aunt’s home. And after installing fedora on her system, we simply install all the rpms on her system. Steps:On our system:Download all rpms required for the extra packages (the package rpms + dependencies)yumdownloader --destdir=rpmsForAunt --resolve rpmName(s) OR create a service pack of all pending updates or certain rpms using gpk-service-packyum install gnome-packagekit-extra OR Edit /etc/yum.conf and change the value of keepcache to 1. After the update is done, the downloaded rpm files then can be found in (and copied from) subfolders named “packages” in /var/cache/yum. When you’re done with them you can get rid of them to save disk space with yum clean packages.On our aunt’s system: Install fedora. Install the extra downloaded rpms: You need to disable all repositories before yum localinstall will work without net access.

    <title><![CDATA[India, and Mr. God]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2008%2Findia-and-mr-god%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[So long since I have written anything. And there’s so much I want to write. But I ll write about what’s on the top of my mind right now. Yesterday (Diwali), Rajni aunty, mom’s friend, came to our house. Her son, (Mr. X we’ll call him) went straight to everyone’s feet wishing them Happy Diwali, conjuring a smile on everyone’s face as they blessed him (I know, a strange custom. Hopefully will be prevalent only for one more generation). Then he dashed towards the glass table where we had kept crackers we had dried all day long on the roof. We didn’t buy any crackers this year, we used only what we had from last year. We had a special matchstick that was a mini-sparkler. Mr. X took that out. I don’t know what possessed him, but what he did next was insane. He lit the match stick, on top of the stack of crackers. The crackers caught fire. Yes, inside my house. There was a stack of loose electric crackers that caught fire and thus were lighting each other. And all of them started bursting one after the other. The whole commotion went on for around a minute after which the electric crackers ran out. After the smoke settled, I saw a few atom bombs (green coloured crackers filled with gunpowder tightly wrapped with rope) lying on the glass table. I couldn’t help thinking what might have happened had that the atom bombs gotten lit on the glass table. (Anyone heard of pipe bombs used in delhi blasts? A Hint : Its the shreds that cause the maximum damage. Not the shockwave) A question to “modern” parents : should children be beaten up for their misdeeds? You decide. Now, coming back to the title of the post. After the smoke settled, Mom took a broom and swiped all the leftovers to one side. (Our sofa got burnt partially). After swiping the burnt cracker papers to one side, as she was about to swipe them out of the door, Mr. X’s mom says “Don’t swipe them out of the house. It’s considered a sin to clean the house during Diwali.” After all this. I don’t think God would mind. Will India ever prosper? Not until our value system and reason is so deeply screwed up with religion and baseless customs. Here’s an article I read minutes after writing my post, reinforcing what I just wrote.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This wednesday, working at Goldman Sachs, I got a call from Santa Fe. The guy asked me when I wanted him to bring my luggage to my house. I said Saturday (yesterday) around 10 am. Yesterday, he reached here at 9:55. After everything was brought in and kept at the wanted places, he gave me a feedback form. And boy, the first question was : Were we on time? The options were : a) on time b) 5 min late c) 10 min late d) 30 min late and nothing after that. They DON’T HAVE a concept of getting late more than half an hour!! Compare that to the Indian based relocation services. What options should their feedback forms have ? How much late were we? a) 1 day 2) 2 day 3) 1 week 4) 2 weeks 5) luggage lost in transit!]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2008%2Fso-many-things-so-less-time%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hello Banagalore!!! Anshu came here last week. We had a gr8 time!! He reached here last Saturday. We had an Italian brunch here at a great place named Casa Picolo on CMH road. We asked Sriram where we could go. He told us about a great place to shop - Brigade road. Me and Anshu first went to MG road and set about searching for his memory card. We found a great lane there to shop which joined M.G. road at the middle from the left. We spent our time till the evening there going from shop to shop. From there, we went to meet one of Anshu’s friend Kriti, at Garuda mall. We took an auto to reach there. At Garuda mall, Anshu bought a few clothes for his interview. After that, she took us to Brigade road. We were walking that road, Anshu stopped suddenly and exclaimed, “I have come here before”. We were on Brigade road the whole afternoon and we didn’t know it!!. And we took an auto to Garuda mall, which was walking distance from there. I wonder which route he took us from. We went to cafe coffee day there, and them came back. The next day, we went to a great place called Marathalli. It’s a great place for shopping. I got 50% off on my Rebook shoes! And Anshu found the memory card he was searching for the whole day on M.G. the whole day but had found only duplicate, China made cards ! Next Wednesday my mom is coming, and so now am making a list of places to take her to, and yes, all the above mentioned place are there in the list. And ya, forgot to mention, I spent the weekend before Anshu’s visit in Google office in K.R. Puram, eating chocos and maggi, and playing pool and foosball. This album basically summarizes what I did on that week’s Firday (the 13th) : http://picasaweb.google.com/sahilahuja/ChennaiTripForVISAInterview Time has flown by since I came to Bangalore. It’s already time for me to get ready for my New York trip!]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Fedora 9 Released!!!]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2008%2Ffedora-9-released%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[And it rocks!! The first thing you notice after fedora 9 is the blazing faaaast startup and shutdown times. Now, before I say anything else about Fedora 9, here are a few screenshots : Here’s Gnome in F9 : And here is KDE 4 (finally !!): KDE 4 seems to be following the footsteps of some of its latest applications like Basket. The new start menu now acts like that of IPOD. And the inbuilt search as shown in the following video is simply amazing!. The whole desktop has been given a major revamp. And so has been the theme. The widgets on the desktop now act a bit like widgets on Vista. Among the key features, the feature that i think will prove to be indispensable later in making fedora more famous is the windows fedora live usb creator. A feature (a release method actually) that really helped me a lot in creating the live DVD is Jigdo. Here is what the official release notes say about Jigdo : Fedora releases are also available via Jigdo. This distribution method can improve the speed of obtaining the installation ISO images. Instead of waiting for torrent downloads to complete, Jigdo seeks the fastest mirrors it can find via the Fedora Project Mirror Manager infrastructure, and downloads the bits it needs from these mirrors. To optimize seeking these bits, you can tell Jigdo to scan a DVD or CD you already have, and cut down on redundant downloads. This feature becomes particularly useful if you: 1. Download all the test releases and then get the final release, in which case you have 90% of the data already with each subsequent download. 2. Download both the DVD and the CD set, in which case the DVD holds 95% of the data needed for the CD sets. 3. Download any combination of the above. Anaconda, the installer for fedora, now supports resizing of ntfs, ext3 and ext4 partitions during installation. This will be of great help to windows users. (yes, it supports ext4 now.) Also, it gives an option of installing encrypted partitions. Business users ought to try this, but with caution.Here is a list of all the new features in fedora 9.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Here is a list of things I have done in the past three years. I have written for the sake of personal record. As a member of Delta :Created a “PC Based Oscilloscope“ in IIT Bombay, as a summer project. Used java servlets on the server side and a java applet on the client side. Was responsible for the whole of the software side - 2006 SummersWorked in Pragyan CMS V1, which finally got implemented in our college website - 2005-2007Made Dalal Street, a stock market simulator using java servlets on the server side and using eclipse to make a java based ui compiled using gcj to eliminate the need of jvm to run the final executable - 2006 Dec - 2007 JanUsed CVS for the development of Dalal Street, understood the importance of a code versioning system. As being a part of Delta Core (Technology Changes) :Implemented LDAP using openldap, in Delta, allowing everyone to have a central authentication server, with a common login everywhere, where everywhere includes :system login in Sun Lab compsImplemented NFS) on Delta, which gets mounted on all Sun Lab comps, using the default nfs service provided by default on fedora, so everyone has the same home irrespective of the comp they login to, which they do through their ldap accounts.Implemented pure-ftpd on Delta, configured it to work through ldap, allowing everyone to access their home drives even from “outside” (the user labs).Setup, and advocated use of Doku for information keeping, made it work through LDAP.Implemented and introduced SVN) on Delta, setup three repositories : pragyan, delta and dalal, delta for the use of all delta projects.Implemented and introduced trac on delta, setup three repositories : pragyan, delta and dalal. Customized all of these three. Learned how to customize through .egg files.Made svn and trac work through httpd authentication, which used LDAP to get authentication details. (this was hell)Revived delta as a student group - meaning, made sure many meetings were held, made sure everyone knew each other, everyone contributed something to delta and felt a part of the group, made sure many treats were held, and chucked a few inactive members out of delta.Created Pragyan CMS V2, from scratch. As being Pragyan’08 Systems head :Implemented mail system through postfix, made its authentication work through ldap. Implemented mailman like features using contact attribute in ldap and aliases in postfix.Made dovecot work through ldap too.Learned what SSL certificates are, how they work, created a self signed ssl certificate for pragyan.org, using tinyCA2 provided in Fedora, and made it use it. (basically, allowed the use of https://pragyan.org/...)Implemented FDS (Fedora Directory Server) as a much better alternative to LDAP on Pragyan Server.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2008%2Fcrazy-svn-httpd-errors-301-302%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Yup. SVN IS MAD. Sorry, SVN and HTTPD team up to drive people crazy. I just came across two (or maybe three) of their misdoing in my effort to setup SVN on http://repos.nitt.edu 1) First, with this nitt.edu.conf in /etc/httpd/conf.d directory :1234567&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; ServerName repos.nitt.edu DocumentRoot &quot;/var/www/html&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;I got an error&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff0000;&quot;&gt;RA layer request failedsvn: PROPFIND request failed on &apos;/pragyan&apos;svn: PROPFIND of &apos;/pragyan&apos;: 302 Found (http://repos.nitt.edu)&lt;/span&gt; I found this article : http://ynniv.com/blog/2005/12/troubling-svn-error.html It said that the error occurs when some cms meddles with the way non existent file message (404) is shown. This,… was my case. (Thanks to my Praygan CMS). So then I changed my document root to /var/www/svn. Then with12345678&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;ServerName repos.nitt.eduDocumentRoot &quot;/var/www/svn&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;I got an error&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff0000;&quot;&gt;RA layer request failedsvn: PROPFIND request failed on &apos;/pragyan&apos;svn: PROPFIND of &apos;/pragyan&apos;: 301 Moved Permanently (http://repos.nitt.edu)&lt;/span&gt; Article that helped me in this grave time of need was : http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#http-301-error It said that the error occurs because, when configuring SVN to work with httpd, the virtualhost document root shouldn’t contain the repository location (or httpd gets confused or something). My repos location was /var/www/svn/pragyan (which was within Document root). I simply changed the DocumentRoot to /var/www/svn/DocumentRoot and all started working well again.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Creating your own schemas in FDS Ldap for use in postfix (or anything else for that matter) :P]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2008%2Fcreating-your-own-schemas-in-fds-ldap-for-use-in-postfix-or-anything-else-for-that-matter-p%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[What I needed for mailman like functioning while making postfix work with ldap was an attribute that stores content of type DN (Distinguished Name) i.e. a node address, or holding a data type that stores nothing but data of type that can hold address of the data type itself. In openldap, I used a schemas called evolutionPerson and evolutionPersonList (available with my fedora openldap distribution by moving evolutionperson.schema in /usr/share/evolution-data-server-1.12/ to /etc/opanldap/schemas/). evolutionPerson is very similar to inetOrgPerson class, which stores basically everything that could ever be used to describe a person. The reason I chose evolutionPerson over inetOrgPerson was the availablity of the evolutionPersonList class. Its attributes are : mail, contact and listnName, where both mail and contact can contain more than one values. mail and listName attribute type is text, and contact attribute type is DN. contact’s were used to create groups, and mail’s were used to forward the email to a third party server. Here is a screenshot of the same in action : The contact attribute worked like charm. If any contact attribute turns out to be another evolutionPersonList, it repeats the whole process again for it, collecting new mails from it, and if it turns out to be evolutionPerson, it takes its mail attribute. The whole process repeats itself, taking care that infinite loops do not get created. In the end, what we get a list of mail ids to which the mail has to be sent. Now, I haven’t yet figured out how to add evolutionperson.schema to schema. So, what did I do for delta?? I simply created my own schema. For a user, I already had whatever I needed in inetOrgPerson. All I need was some sort of an inetOrgPersonList. So, here are the steps : I am assuming you have already setup fedora directory server through the wonderful install scripts provided. (/usr/sbin/setup-ds-admin.pl and then /usr/sbin/setup-ds.pl) Open Fedora Directory Server admin console : /usr/bin/fedora-idm-console Under the server groups entry in the default view tree, select your directory server and open it, using the DN and password you provided earlier during the directory server setup. Under the to configuration tab, select schema. Select Attributes in the right hand pane. Create a new attribute by clicking on the new attribute button at the bottom of the right pane. I needed two new attributes for my purpose : contact : of type DN, multi valued. listName : of type String, single valued. The third multivalued attribute I needed, mail, already exists. Now, under the Object Classes pane, create any number of Objects you nees, using the attributes you just now created, or the preexisting ones. The one created was inetorgpersonlist having Required Attributes listName and objectClass, and Allowed Attributes contact and mail.That’s it!!]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2008%2Fpublic-html-web-server-without-mod-userdir%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hell, what does the title mean?? It means this : Allow people to put files in the public_html folder in their home directories and allow it to be seen through the web server of that server in this format : http://servername/~username/hisorherfiles Most people use mod_userdir to allow ~username directories in their webservers. However, there is simple rewrite rule workaround that eliminates the need for mod_userdir. I needed this because we had the home directories on the server, but the users had no login accounts on the server and they needed their public_html to work. Here is how it goes : 123456789101112131415161718192021#First, disable the default thing : &lt;IfModule mod_userdir.c&gt; UserDir disable&lt;/IfModule&gt;#Then the rewrite rule&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#To prevent access to files ~something.html and #something.html#&lt;Files ~ &quot;.*(~|#)$&quot;&gt; Order allow,deny Deny from all&lt;/Files&gt;#To show public_html access RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %&#123;REQUEST_URI&#125; ^/~\w+/.*$ RewriteRule /~(\w+)/(.*) /webteam/$1/public_html/$2 RewriteCond %&#123;REQUEST_URI&#125; ^/~\w+$ RewriteRule /~(\w+) /webteam/$1/public_html/#To enable .htaccess rules in public_html&lt;Directory /webteam/*/public_html&gt; AllowOverride All&lt;/Directory&gt;]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2008%2Fmail-with-postfix-and-ldap%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Yes, it’s possible. I did it for the pragyan.org server. The setup we used was : /var/mail/virtual/%u: the inboxes of different users, /var/mail/virtual/PragyanMail/%u/%f: the different folders in mailboxes of different users. It’s much easily setup than one thinks initially. HOW?? Here’s how: But, as with anything else, basics first SMTP server : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol : The server which sends and receives mails. Postfix (or smtp). IMAP server : Internet Message Access Protocol : The service which interacts with the SMTP server to access mail and send mail. Dovecot These come preinstalled in most linux distributions. Apart from these, other tricks that can be used by people to confuse simple minded, bread earning people like us are : MTA : Mail transfer agent : A computer program or software agent that transfers electronic mail messages from one computer to another. (Eg: Postfix, Sendmail) MDA : Mail delivery agent : A Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) is software that delivers e-mail messages right after they’ve been accepted on a server, distributing them to recipients’ individual mailboxes. (Eg: dovecot) MUA : Mail user agent : An e-mail client, aka Mail User Agent (MUA), aka email reader is a frontend computer program used to manage email. (Eg: gmail, evolution, horde, squirrelmail, Outlook Express.)Now that thats out of the way, lets get our hands dirty. But again, not so fast. As with anything in linux, when you set off to configure something, you end up knowing much more than you bargained for. ;) AliasesAliases are mappings between one source name and one or many destination name (in mail). Aliases can be found out from flat files in the form of mapping, from sql queries or from ldap (man ldap_table). The source itself can be in the destination. Link to alias files is given in /etc/postfix/main.cf at linealias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases, ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf Type /usr/sbin/postmap -q core@pragyan.org ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf to see its effects. local_transportThe local_transport parameter corresponds to the mail delivery agent used. The default with postfix is local. The problem with local is that is requires local users and hence, a posixAccount schema to be an objectClass of every mail account. Rejected. Btw local also has to ability of mail forwarding to a user. i.e. if mailbox of user user1 is user1@gmail.com (user forwarding), then local will also forward to user1@gmail.com. By default, it assumes the uid of the user it is delivering mail to while delvering mail. Next is virtual. This is the one used. Virtual accepts users who are system users. But virtual (for security purposes) does not forward to hosts other than the localhost. So how do we forward to external hosts? virtual forwards in case the mails are aliases. So we simply put the gmail address as the entry of one of the aliases of the mail. If virtual MDA is used then whose uid does it use? (because the uid of the user himself doesn’t exist on the system). Another parameter value has to be used : 123virtual_minimum_uid = 100 (security feature)virtual_uid_maps = static:700virtual_gid_maps = static:700 Other mail delivery agents : procmail doesn’t understand LDAP, and maildrop has too much overhead. Group expansionExcellent notes are available in /usr/share/doc/postfix-2.4.3/README_FILES/LDAP_README. Any “map” parameter value, like alias_maps, can be either given a flat mapping file name, or a .cf file, with tells it what to do to get the mapping, in this format : protocol:filename. Eg. virtual_mailbox_maps = ldap:/etc/postfix/accountsmap.cf Mail boxesmbox is a format for storing mails. It is the default format used in postfix and dovecot. This is a line from dovecot conf :mail_location = mbox:/var/spool/mail/virtual/PragyanMail/%u:INBOX=/var/spool/mail/virtual/%u The first part (mbox:/var/spool/mail/virtual/PragyanMail/%u:INBOX=/var/spool/mail/virtual/%u) refers to the user’s mail folder, which contains all his mail folders (Trash, drafts, sent mail.. ) (the user’s mail folders are files in mbox format) The second part (mbox:/var/spool/mail/virtual/PragyanMail/%u:INBOX=/var/spool/mail/virtual/%u) refers to the one specific user folder (i.e. server file) which postfix writes to, that is his INBOX. (All other folders are written to and handled by the IMAP client - dovecot.) Other variables which could have been used for specifying this are : %u - username, %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there’s no domain, %d - domain part in user@domain, %h - home directory etc. A virtual user can specify his mail folder to be anywhere. So, the following is a security config for postfix INBOX files : virtual_mailbox_base = /var/spool/mail/virtual Also chmod g+s /usr/bin/procmail for it to be able to create mail directories Maps specified in postfixMaps are specified in /etc/postfix/main.cf. Important maps to be specified are : User aliases virtual_alias_maps - mapping between group@domain.org and user1@pragyan.org, user2@pragyan.org, … User mailboxes virtual_mailbox_maps - mapping between mailaddress (user1@pragyan.org) and mailbox location (/var/spool/mail/virtual/user1). A confirmation that the mail address corresponds to a real virtual user. For mail to be delivered, this entry needs to be there, which contains the mailbox address. This is but only a one to one mapping. (Ignores all following values)local_recipient_maps = $virtual_mailbox_mapsThis line is required whenever the local_transport is changed to something else. (in this case to virtual) Schemas (The Real Working): Ldap Entry evolutionPersonListcontact (multiple) : links to others ldap entries : uid=sahil,ou=P… , uid=cyber, ou=.. , …mail (multiple) : mails : sahilahuja@gmail.com, core@pragyan.org, …listName (single) : list name : coding main.cf entry : virtual_alias_maps = ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf.

The query runs recursively runs on field “contact”. All mails of form alias@pragyan.org again go through the same process. Ldap entry evolutionPerson . Important thing in it is the mapping between uid and mail. It’s a proof to postfix the user is a real virtual user. main.cf entry virtual_mailbox_maps = ldap:/etc/postfix/accountsmap.cf. Contents of accountsmap.cf : 1234567server_host = 10.0.0.126search_base = ou=People,ou=Pragyan,dc=delta,dc=nitt.eduquery_filter = (&amp;amp;(objectClass=*)(mail=%s))result_attribute = uidbind = yesbind_dn = cn=dovecot,ou=Pragyan,dc=delta,dc=nitt.edu[gallery]bind_pw = ****** The final main.cf entry that fits it all : virtual_mailbox_base = /var/spool/mail/virtual . A file with the name that is a result of the previous query (uid), gets created in this directory as the inbox of the user.Workflow is mailid → getaliases → Use alias result to get mail ids → deliver. That is, first alaises get processed, then accountsmap. Here are the files I used finally : Postfix : main.cf, accountsmap.cf, ldap-alias.conf Dovecot : dovecot.conf, dovecot-ldap.conf Here is a compilation of the final content of these files.

I am not BOSSY!I just have better ideas. I don’t suffer from insanity.I enjoy every minute of it. Has any of this time-saving technology ever let you go home one minute early? The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from. You are in a twisty little passage of standards, all conflicting Implementation is the fruitless struggle by the talented and underpaid to fulfill promises made by the rich and ignorant. My software never has bugs. It just develops random features. Windows: Just another pane in the glass. Doing a job RIGHT the first time gets the job done. Doing the job WRONG fourteen times gives you job security. TEAMWORK means never having to take all the blame yourself. We waste time, so you don’t have to. We waste more time by 8:00 in the morning than other companies do all day. Work: It isn’t just for sleeping anymore. The one I chose : I don’t suffer from insanity.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Only yesterday I was having a discussion with Purnima on the way while escorting her to the station. How should you spend your life such that you have no regrets about it in your death bed? I haven’t figured out the answer for myself yet. I tend to try to achieve as much as possible. But why? A part of the answer is my thirst for knowledge, my unending desire to make sure things work and another part is, I fear, to make others look up to me. But this again conflicts with my notion of not having a role model. Why do what others have done before? How does that make your life worthwhile? And by worthwhile I mean precious, non replaceable. In other words, I tell myself it doesn’t matter what others think of me. But I it still does matter to me what others think. As for the question what makes one life complete/worthwhile/not regrettable, will blog about it when the answer comes to me.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Why it is the biggest mistake of your lifetime to go out with a member of the website development team of one of the most spectacular technical festivals in India..Springtime is here- a season of new beginnings, love, laughter and happiness. A great situation for budding relationships you may think. But will the blossom stand the frost of the web team lab of NIT Trichy. I can assure you that it is a trial by fire.This doesn’t happen only to nerd types or programming fanatics, it can happen to anyone.. cos that s the kind of single minded devotion that Pragyan demands from all those who work for it.The guy I am dating is normal, that is, as far as guys g.. which isn’t saying too much..:) but he seems to have gotten stuck in a sorta time warp.. with selective memory loss..Imagine our stone age ancestors.. the times when shaving razors and bath soaps were out of fashion. Waiting in front of the campus main block for a couple of minutes can magically transport you back.. No prizes for guessing what my boy friend’s selective amnesia includes..For starters.. FOOD, HYGIENE, SLEEP and also most importantly ME..A day in my life would illustrate this better..7:30 am Respective HostelsME: “Hey!! GET UP.. u r gonna be late.. 8:30 class.. anyway when did u sleep yesterday”HIM:” I dunno.. three.. four.. “ SILENCEME: “ GET UP.. Don t go back to sleep”HIM:”Watever…Yawwnn”8:30 am ClassME: (SMS) “ u get here now.. u cant bunk more than four classes”HIM.. no reply.. dashes in when teacher is about to lock the door”12:10 pmME: “Lunch??”HIM: “ Oh.. sorry I have a meeting at one.. very important.. how about dinner… say sevenish, canteen?”ME:”K..”7:15 pm CanteenMe:(Thinking)” I ‘ll wait a while and then call”7:30pmMe: (Calling)His phone:”Error in network connection”,” number busy”7:45 pmMe: (SMS) U plan on coming or no..try again to callFinally..” The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off”8:15 pmHIM :”I am really sorry. Didnt mean to.. i was giving ppl work.. then jus wen i was coming out i met X.. I had to talk to him.. “Phone rings..HIM(on the phone):”Yeah tell me.. blaaah blaah blaah..”Finally five minutes of peace.. we eat in silence.. then suddenlyHIM:”Server ke liye kuch karna padega”Me:(THINKING) “ Can he pls stop thinking abt work for a while..”10:00 pmON phoneHIM: “I am busy.. can i call u later??”Me: “cool”12:00 amDITTO1:00 amME:” U better sleep if you want to attend class tomorrow..”4:00 amHIM:” I am going to sleep now..”ME:”HMMM..” doze off and put the phone down..and another brand new day with the same old routine begins..Well all relationships need a trial; we are serving our internships now..

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2007%2Fback-to-square-one%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I am back home at Faridabad now. It was a great journey form Trichy to here. Me and Ankit came together. We caught Rockfort express from Trichy and reached Chennai around 5:30 in the morning. Once we got down the train, we leisurely checked the time for our next train - Gareeb Rath. We had to go from Chennai Egmore station to Chennai Central station to catch the train. And the time for the departure of the train wasss…. 6:10 am. I walked as fast as I could to keep pace with the nervous Ankit, carrying my ridiculously heavy prehistoric suitcase. When we reached the exit of the station, we were in such a hurry, that we agreed to an autowala when he quoted the price Rs. 50. We got into the auto and the auto took us to the station. When he stopped, he stopped in the main road. He said it would be faster if we got off here and walked to the entrance of the station, saying something in tamil-english of which I could catch only the following : “round, longer, less time, entrance, route”. We got off, and found out none of us had Rs. 50 change. I took out Rs. 100 and asked him to please find change from somewhere. He got off, went to few autowalas, then came back running, got into the auto, and drove off as fast as lightning. Ankit was cursing him. This is the first time I got bagged so openly. We went into the station, found our train, got in at around 6am. Ankit got off to get breakfast, which consisted of 2 sandwiches, 2 garlic chicken puffs, and 2 simple chicken puffs. We ate it at around 6:30 am. It was delicious. Gareeb Rath was a strange train. It had 84 seats instead of the normal 72 seats. They achieved this by mounting 3 seats in the side berth instead of the normal 2. The journey was quite smooth. We spent the whole day configuring his laptop. First we repartitioned his hard-disk to backup all his data. Ended up using all the utilities which I had burnt up for purnima into CD’s. Then installed Windows XP, then installed Linux Fedora 8, then setup all his repositories. Then around 7 pm, we watched the movie Amityville. We put down all the curtains and turned off all lights. The compartment was almost like a movie theatre. We watched the whole movie, which I discovered after watching for the first 10 minutes I had already watched. The train was 3 and a half hours late. Mom came to recieve me at H.Nizamuddin station. We cought a Delhi-Mumbai train to go back to Faridabad. On the way I discovered that the hols won’t be as free as I assumed them to be when Mom started laying out my time table in front of me.. “ Tuesday Mama’s birthday, tomorrow movie, Wednesday back, Thursday carpenter”…. Gimme a break! Tomorrow’s plan of watching “I am Legend”, starring Will Smith, got preponed to today, and I am writing this blog after coming back from the movie from SRS plaza - PVR.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2007%2Ftrip-to-goa%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I just came back from Goa today morning. It was the best trip of my life. We stayed there 3 days (3rd dec to 5th dec) in a guest house that Saurabh Shirolkar (a.k.a. Badri) had booked for us. We got a really nice deal. After that (5th dec) I went to my tayaji’s (Jayant Rai) house to stay there for 1 day. The next day on 6th dec, I left. The first day we went to a commercial beach where we paraglided. After paragliding we all came back to the beach and I and Cyber did water biking and the others did something known as a “banana flip”. After that, a few of us went for a walk along the beach. I stayed behind. When they came back they said they saw three topless babes. I cursed at them for not taking a pic. After that we went to a second more peaceful beach and had a nice time. All of us had rented Activa’s for transportation. Activa’s are tourists’ primary transportation in Goa as all other means are simply maddeningly unaffordable. The second day we went to Chapora fort. The same place where the movie “Dil Chahata Hai “ shot 2 scenes. It was a nice climb. The view from along the route was simply breath taking. I took a lot of pics. The 3rd day we had a great time at the beach playing football. Then I went with my friends sharing the cab with them and they dropped my at my tayiji’s place (Navneet Rai). Around 2 o’clock their daughter Megha came back from school. She is studying in 12th std and is really fond of reading. She want’s to become a journalist and has taken art’s stream in her 12th in Goa board. We got along really well. That night, tayiji took me to the market and bought me two pants and also a shirt for my brother. Jayant tayaji took me to the station in his car on the second day. I bid them good bye. On my way back to Trichy I had a 9hr stop at Bangalore. I bought new Creative earphones in Bangalore. In the evening I went caught the train to Erode from where I took the train to Trichy, from where I am currently writing this blog.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today is a great day!! For the first time I was able to cross view. And only today I found out the type of stereograms I used to play with were parallel viewing. To find the difference between them go here or here. (Gosh! wikipedia articles for cross view and parallel view don’t exist. I could create one someday!)Here is a great tutorial to get you started with crossviewing. Normal viewing : Parallel viewing :Brain thinks image is farther.In case of two adjacent images, L R | | L R -&gt; eyes, right eye sees right image, left eye sees left, and we overlap these two. Crossviewing :Brain thinks image is nearer.In case of two adjacent images, L R \/ /\ L R -&gt; eyes, right eye sees left image, left eye sees right, and we overlap these two.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Normal forms]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2007%2Fnormal-forms%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Sitting here in Morgan Stanley, it’s hard to find free time. Things are always on the run. But one day, I did find free time, and did what I had wanted to do for a very long time - learn about Normal forms in RDBMS. Here is what I gathered from these websites : http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/1549781 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization http://www.datamodel.org/NormalizationRules.html1st Normal Form: No multivalued attribute |StudID|Course| |—|—| |12345|3100,3600,3900| |54321|1300,2300,3400| (Wrong) No repeating group |StudID|Course1|Course2|Course3| |—|—|—|—| | 12345 | 3100 | 3600 | 3900 | |54321 | 1300 | 2300 | 3400 | (Wrong) Presence of atleast one unique identifier (addn of ID field) | StudID|Course | |—|—| |12345 | 3100| |12345 | 3600| |54321 | 1300| |54321 | 2300| (Right) There needs to be one composite key atleast. (One or more fields that can be used to distinguish every row uniquely). In the above example, if it was possible for the same student to take the same course twice, then we would have to add another uID field to bring the DB to the first normal form. 2nd Normal Form:The DB is in this if all non-prime attributes are completely dependent on a candidate key. (and not on a part of it). i.e. no repetition of key detail in one detail StudID CourseID StudNm ProfID ProfName 123456 310000 April00 6789 David 123456 410000 April00 2345 David 123456 210000 April00 6789 David Candidate Key = StidID + CourseID But StudNm (student name) depends only on StudID (and not on StudID + CourseID)Had prof been just a function of course, even that would have to be removed.Hence it is not in 2nd NF.The ProfName-ProfID dependency is removed in the 3rd NF (where no attribute can be dependent on a non-key attribute in that table).No part key dependencies can exist in 2nd NF. None of the non-prime attributes of the table are functionally dependent on a part (proper subset) of a candidate key; in other words, all functional dependencies of non-prime attributes on candidate keys are full functional dependencies. For example, in an “Employees’ Skills” table whose attributes are Employee ID, Employee Address, and Skill, the combination of Employee ID and Skill uniquely identifies records within the table. Given that Employee Address depends on only one of those attributes – namely, Employee ID – the table is not in 2NF. Candidate key: A candidate key is a minimal superkey, that is, a superkey for which we can say that no proper subset of it is also a superkey. {Employee Id, Skill} would be a candidate key for the “Employees’ Skills” table. uperkey: A superkey is an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identifies rows within a table; in other words, two distinct rows are always guaranteed to have distinct superkeys. {Employee ID, Employee Address, Skill} would be a superkey for the “Employees’ Skills” table; {Employee ID, Skill} would also be a superkey. Non-prime attribute: A non-prime attribute is an attribute that does not occur in any candidate key. Employee Address would be a non-prime attribute in the “Employees’ Skills” table. Primary key: Most DBMSs require a table to be defined as having a single unique key, rather than a number of possible unique keys. A primary key is a candidate key which the database designer has designated for this purpose.Some thoughts : In and after 2nd NF, all tables have only one candidate key. -&gt; FALSE All candidate keys in a table map to each other one to one. -&gt; TRUE What normalization stage ensures that only one candidate key is remaining? None. Beacause normalization aims at reducing data duplication and inconsistencies. Candidate keys in a table causes no redundency. If a table in 1st NF has no composite candidate keys (candidate keys consisting of more then one attributes), then it is automatically in 2nd NF. 3rd Normal Form:No non-transitive dependencies:A non-transitive dependency is one in which an attribute is dependent on a non-key attribute in that table.For example, in the ProfID example given above, to bring it to 3rd normal form, ProfName and ProfID would have to brought to a separate table. Because ProfName is a non-transitive dependency. In 2nd Normal form, all candidate keys become mutually independent. FALSE In 2nd Normal form, any candidate key is a candidate key (i.e. is a sufficient and necessary dependency) for all other attributes. FALSE - this happens in 3rd NF. In 3rd Normal form, non-prime attributes become dependent on a candidate key. TRUE]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fa-few-notes-on-exposure%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Exposure refers to the amount of light falling onto the camera sensor. It is governed by two things : The sensitivity of the medium the light is falling on (the ISO setting of your camers). The length of time for which the shutter the open and the apperture size (the brightness setting of your camera.So, if you want a bright image, either increase the ISO sensitivity or increase the brightness. Increasing ISO sensitivity reduces image quality by increasing noise. Increasing brightness reduces the image quality by reducing the shutter speed. For a great special effect reduce the ISO sensitivity and increase the brightness to get the same effect you would get by moving the “levels” center controller in any image editting software to the left. This is because of the increased exposure time. For a natural looking image reduce the brightness and increase the ISO sensitivity.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The more I use digiKam, the more I appreciate it. I can’t imagine managing my photos without it! (sorry windoze user :P ) The one feature the really struck me was the advanced search features. In digiKam you can create complicated search queries and can store the resulting photos as a group! Neat…In the many chronologically arranged albums I had, I tagged the pics I liked with the tag “Cool shots”. Then to get all the cool pics at once, all I had to do run a search for all pics tagged “Cool shots” and it would show up all the nice pics all at once. The combinations are endless. For example, you might want to look at only the “nice” pics from the shots of your cousin you took. One more great thing about digiKam is all its cool plugins. One really utilitarian plugin is the red eye removal plugin. It does work.]]></content>

This wish was fulfilled during these holidays.I had gotten my mother a Sony DSC-W70 last time I had come for holidays after the IITB project. But that had been only for 2 weeks and I had barely gotten a day with the camera.But this time….. things were different (with an evil smile). I got all the time I wanted with the camera. I played with it to my heart’s content. Here are some of my shots :]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fmy-sister-my-inspiration%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A lot happened when my closest sister Pooja came to Delhi to her nani’s house. She had come to collect the fittjee scholarship she had gotten because of coming within the top 50 all over India in one of fittjee’s scholarship test.It all started while Pooja, Sagar and me were sitting on the bed playing Uno. A thought occured to me of teasing her. So I simply asked her - what would be the probability of one us winning a cards game in which one and only one of the players win? Probability is topic in standard X and she was in standard XI. She immediately replied -1, while my bro kept thinking. I was impressed by her sharpness.Then I asked them a few more probability questions (my favourite topic ;) ) and she answered most of them! I was awe-struck. She had joint fiitjee coching in IX and had improved by leaps and bounds! No wonder she came within India’s top 50..Meeting her made me feel ashamed of myself. How I had wasted my self. She had the determination of a winner. While I get very easily distracted (whenever I work that is). I do everything but study on the study table! Think about everything that’s not related to study. Every half-completed work that got left uncompleted for some reason has to be completed then. Every movie that I wished to see has to be seen then. What an ass-hole I am!]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fusing-digikam-for-managing-photos%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today I discovered one of the coolest softwares to manage photos from a digicam! The software’s name is digiKam. The thing I liked the most about the software is the date view and the album view. I own a Sony W70. It has 2 modes of connecting to the computer (both use the USB connecting cable provided with the camera). One is the “USB Mass Storage mode” and the other is the “PTP/IP Camera” mode. I asked my camera to show itself using the PTP.. mode (through the camera menu interface) and selected the import option in digiKam. Importing photos in digiKam really is easy. After the photos get imported, in the date view all the photos show up in a cool chronological order. In the album view you can arrange the pics according to your preference. You can have albums, sub-albums, sub-sub-albums… in a folder tree fashion. digiKam lets you resize, crop, rotate your images and apply simple color filters, adjust levels etc. It also has a cool feature of displaying the “EXIF” data of an image. That is basically information like focal length, digital zoom, exposure, ISO level and other details about the snap itself.]]></content>

The hols before that I had come for 2 weeks but those had gone by in training at ABB. So this is one time when i am really home.) One reason I am delibrately writing this blog is Hari’s suggestion of writing blogs regularly. I got the tickets for bengaluru today for the hpic conference. I also took the gre diagnostic test today – it simply shook my feet. I got 1010 out of 1600 in the test. 310 in verbal and 700 in quantitative. That’s … bad. I havn’t yet written my CV.

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Ffile-sharing-on-lan%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I was thinking of various ways of sharing stuff (movies, mp3’s… you know.. the illegal kind) on our lan… And here is what I came up with : Use ftp - Create ftp servers, have a central site having the list of these servers. Use nothing - a revolutionary way of simply sharing through windows “share file” feature and setting up samba servers in linux. Use p2p file-sharing - by using one of the protocols listed here.Out of these…… I like the p2p file sharing method. Coz : It’s the right way to do it in a network like our’s. Yup. That’s it.Now…. read on only if you are interested (otherwise skip) or you will sleep. Out of the listed protocols (from the site I linked to earlier) Gnutella, EDonkey and Direct Connect are the popular ones.The most popular file sharing clients licensed under GPL for Gnutella is LimeWire, for EDonkey it’s aMule, and for Direct Connect it’s DC++. DC++ has the “minimum amount of space needed to be shared in order to connect” feature… so we will use DC++. &gt;=)]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fits-so-easy-resetting-the-root-password-i-mean%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Look at this from Fedora FAQ - Q:How do I reset my root password? A: If you’ve forgotten your root password, and you want to change it, don’t worry! It’s possible. You need to boot into what’s called “single-user mode.” You must be in front of the computer to do this – you can not do it remotely: Using the instructions in the runlevel question (under the “While You Are Booting the Computer” section), boot into runlevel 1. Set the new root password with by typing: passwd And then enter your new root password when asked. Reboot your machine, and you will now be able to log in as root with the new password that you entered. And here’s that runlevel question - While You Are Booting the Computer: When you first start your computer, the GRUB screen (where you choose your Operating System) appears. Select the Fedora that you want to boot into, but press the a key instead of pressing Enter. You will see a line somewhat like the following: kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.9-1.667 ro root=LABEL=/ acpi=on rhgb quiet Add the number of your runlevel to the end of that line, and then press Enter. For example, to boot into text-only mode, the line would look like: kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.9-1.667 ro root=LABEL=/ acpi=on rhgb quiet 3 You will then boot into the new runlevel this time only.This just shows how easy it is hack into our systems unless we secure our grub!]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Finstalling-xgnokii-for-n-gage-in-fedora-core-5%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[There’s no nice guide for this!! So, I made one for myself.I own a Nokia N-Gage RH-29 (The one for Asia … or something like that). Now, I refuse to use windows for seeing all my contacts on the computer. But for using the tool for linux (xgnokii) for Nokia phone doesn’t work right away for Nokia N-Gage. Here is how to make it work - Install gnokii and xgnokii - “yum install gnokii xgnokii”. Follow instructions in the xgnooki wiki with the modifications in steps 3 and 4. For installing the gnapplet.sis in N-Gage (and Nokia 6600), you have to get the one in here. And in gnapplet.ini file, you have to set irda_support = 0. For that copy the file to computer (through memory card reader or any other way), edit it (change 1 to 0 against irda_support), and copy it back to phone’s memory. Now here’s the tricky part - if you use the bluetooth dongle like me for bluetooth connection (or even otherwise), how do you find the bluetooth address for that device ? Here’s how - 1) Plug the device in. 2) login console as root (su) and type “hcitool inq”. The bluetooth address must be displayed in console. Start xgnokii as root (“su”;”xgnooki &amp;”)…. and then the app starts.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fgpl-hijacking%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[LGPL looked like the obvious choice for PCBO when the following problem cropped up - GPL Hijacking. LGPL doesn’t spread to other parts of an application and it does allow being linked with closed-source programs. LGPL is “compatible” with GPL in the sense that you can, at your option, convert a LGPLed program to a GPL one any time you want. Such a change is irreversible. For a small project, this is a risk. If a truly skilled person adds a lot of functionality and relicenses the code to GPL, the LGPLed one would swiftly be abandoned and the GPL-changes cannot be applied back in the LGPL version. Where lies this license problem? MPL itself has no problems with the LGPL or GPL licenses, the problem is on the GNU side. GPL has a problem with MPL.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fgplmpllgpl%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I was trying to decide which license to use for my PCBO. So I had to do a bit of research on the usable licenses. These two sites were very helpful - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Basically GPL is like a virus.All derived and any larger work of which a GPL code is part of, must be open sourced and licensed under GPL. But this imposes a lot of restriction on libraries like glibc which are used in almost every project. So, the LGPL (Library or Lesser GPL) was deviced which allows the LGPLed code to be linked by a non-(L)GPLed program. The LGPL places copyleft restrictions on the program itself but does not apply these restrictions to other software that merely links with the program. The MPL states that derived may not be under MPL but must contain a documentation of all the changes made.Here is a link to a great discussion about the differences of GPL and MPL. Under a copyleft form of copyright license, the restrictions imposed are that the work cannot be copied, modified or used in any subsequent work unless the author of that subsequent work agrees to grant the same copyleft rights to the public to freely copy, use and modify the subsequent work. There are two types of copylefts - Strong copyleft : Which implies derived works of all kind has to have the same copyleft rights. Example is GPL. Weak copyleft : Allows other software to link to the library, and then be redistributed without the legal requirement for the work to be distributed under the library’s copyleft license. Examples are MPL and LGPL.Then there’s also the Apache License which states that all derived work must contain text messages indicating that a work under apache is being used. But PCBO is not derived from apache or tomcat. It runs on them.]]></content>

Except the mess I dont find much difference in the work environment. Atleast in NITT, enthu towards work is the same. The professors here in IIT’s are really dedicated. But then again that can be compensated for by studying more. What are books for?In a nutshell, there is nothing here that can replace our good old OCTA :)]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fmeeting-the-professor%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we met the professor and decided to talk about the RAM and our leaving date. He was under the impression that we were final year students. That was why he had given us the RDS assignment. We corrected him immediately.We discussed Op-amp networks and Schmitt triggers for almost an hour. He told us the pitiful state of education in engineering, the marks-oriented study condition, about how the teachers also were not so up-to-date. We talked to him about the RAM on his unused PC and he consented. However, we found out that it was only 64MB and it would not help us in any way. We decided to run a part of our project on Nitin’s laptop as the RAM was totally insufficient. We improved the slider in the panel. Sahil and Nitin watched Desperate Housewives till very late in the night.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fdesigning-the-panel%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[We woke up early today. We added sliders for providing vertical and horizontal motion of the graph. We also added radio buttons for the time/div and volt/div options. We also provided checkboxes for Pause, Trigger and Vector Mode. We took a half day today. Mr. Pandit also had to leave as he had to correct a mistake in the paper he had been setting. He had to set a paper on AIC (Analog Integrated Circuits) and had by mistake he set a paper on ADIC (Analog and Digital Integrated Circuits). Today Saurabh and Nikhil came to visit us. We went to see X-men 3 in the nearby multiplex. It was a good movie. Came back and watched The Exorcism of Emily Rose and had a debate over the horror movie. Slept late as usual. We also met Sandeep Sahare in the night.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we started writing the project report. We started putting whatever we could find relevent in a document and planned to trim it off later. We planned the size of the report to about 35 pages. We also discussed the front end of the applet. Today Tushar came in the evening and Nitin spent the evening with him.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today was a big day. We achieved direct plotting of data from the MySQL database to the applet at a rate of about 4000 samples/s. We calculated the frequency of the wave. As there was a mismatch in the speeds of Java and C, the displayed frequency was not correct but the code was working. We also started designing the front of the oscilloscope. Hemant visited us today.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we went back to work. Mr. Pandit had told the professor that we had gone to Lamington Road to look for RAM in the torrential rain. We suggested a solution for solving the RDS network solver he had asked us. We were facing problems in implementing the queues and they also were inefficient, so we decided to implement direct streaming of data from the database.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fplanning-ahead%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we formed an idea about how to proceed in the project. We planned on using queues as internal buffers for plotting the data. We also decided on running two threads in Java. One thread would handle the queue and the other would take care of plotting the values. We also used the drawLine() function in Java for joining the points to make the graph look continuous. We studied threads more. We realised that the 256MB RAM wasn’t sufficient for our projec. We watched Fanaa in the night.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[We had to give a presentation on our project to Prof. T. S. Rathore, about what we had achieved and what we planned to achieve further in our project. He saw everyone’s presentations and didn’t comment much on our presentation. We also played with the C code introducing a sleep to reduce the processor load. The code took about 20s instead of the usual 10s. The reason for today’s small blog is we spent yesterday night watching Aladdin and Swordfish.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fplaying-around%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[We realised the transfer of data through php and JavaScript made the process of plotting too slow, giving a plotting rate of only 1 frame/s. We had to take a different path, so we decided to use a Java Servlet. The applet was allowed to interact with the servlet through the sandbox. The servlet interacted with the MySQL databse. The implication of this was that we could achieve frame rates of upto 20 frames/s as the Tomcat server was fast. We decided this today and made a Java applet accept a string variable parameter from the servlet.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today…For the first time we saw values change in the monitor with us changing a knob in our hands!!! (instantaneously)We plotted the graph of the actual and observed readings.. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!! We made a prog for querying C with MySQL and integrated it with PARAPIN. Mr. Pandit told us to ponder more on the diode circuit problem he gave us. Then..I decided..The following approaches are available for giving the data to the JAVA-APPLET: To digitally sign the java applet to allow it make connections to other hosts. To use the tomcat server to make the MySql queries for the applet and ask the applet to connect to tomcat server on port no 80. (The applet is allowed to make connection only to port it was called from.) The 3rd approach.. (My original approach :)To use AJAX to update the data on the client!!The APPLET tag on the webpage has a parameter named PARAM.My theory is -Sahil]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Ftomcat-started%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we successfully interfaced parallel port buffer through C. We started the day late as usual.Vidyadhar Kamble, who was to give us lab equipments had gone on leave and was supposed to return on the next Monday. Then the lab was in hands of Vinod who was quite (damn) unhelpful and refused(!!!) to give us equipments till Vidyadhar returned. So, we went back to our lab and asked Mr. Pandit for help. He pulled out a couple of boxes and arranged for resistors, capacitors, LED’s and gave us a CRO, signal generator and power supply. The fat guy (IIT final year placed in INTEL doing his final year proj.) had taken all of our earlier equipment and wasn’t even working on it. We then went to Prof. M. B. Patil and got three ADC’s from WEL. The WEL lab in charge was Mr. Joshi who was most helpful and gave us a book to photocopy about interfacing the ADC804’s and the much needed single strand wires. We soldered PP connector to single strand wires and connected it to the buffer IC. We tested the ckt and it worked like magic. Our only point of concern was the 40mA current taken by the buffer which increased sometimes on connecting to the computer. Moreover we also made a Tomcat 5 server servlet query a MySQL database.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today is Sunday.We decided on Friday that we’ll be going to Pune.. We reached Pune at 11 P.M. by bus.. On Saturday..We brought all our clothes to Pune to use Isli’s washing machine to wash our clothes. Turned out his washing machine hadn’t been used for 3 months :P . We spent an hour cleaning his washing machine. When Sahil washed his clothes in the washing machine.. and returned after 15 min, the water had turned darker than slum water.(Yuk!). Put his clothes in one more round. Same with Sumit.Then we went to Deccan road. Had a Pizza for lunch. Sahil purchased ‘Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus’. Had some fun at McDonald’s.We came back home, had ice-cream, had chinese for dinner along with Austin Powers I (awesome night!!). Today..Caught bus at Kothrud. Sahil had to stand half of the way coz no seats were left. Reached hostel around 2 P.M. had samosas AND went to the department. Was a rough day. Had nice food in canteen.]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Faamchi-mumbai-kelon-ka-din%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we were beaten up and looted. Well actually we broke the law. The day started with Sahil getting up late. Ladki finally aa gayi. We deposited our login forms. We then took our notebook and set off for Lamington Road to shop for an ADC with a list of 15 prospect ADC’s. Sahil wanted to recharge his mobile. Five buses left for Andheri in front of us. We then waited for an hour till we got a bus. We went to Andheri station and purchased two return tickects for Grant Road. As Sahil and Sumit wanted to book tickets for going home, we decided to book them in Dadar. After roaming a lot on the station, we finally located the place where we wanted to book the tickets. Unfortunately, there was a outstation platform between us and the booth and we were caught by the rascal waiting to catch unawares like us. We were taken to the office where we saw two hooligans getting scores. After bargaining and a lot of gidgidana, we managed to get the fine down from Rs 1254 per person to Rs. 100 per person. We were then sick of Dadar and decided to book the tickets in Churchgate. So we set off for Lamington Road. We searched a lot for Vega and Visha electronic shops and found them in an hour. Only Vega had one of our 15 ADC’s and that was costing Rs.850. We also learned that the market had fallen 826 points. We then had food at King’s. We roamed a lot on foot searching for an internet cafe, but after another hour of fruitless search, we found that the nearest internet cafe was in Chowpatty. We were frustrated and decided to leave for Churchgate. We booked new return tickets for Churchgate. We went in a comparitively empty train and went to the reservation center where there was a long queue but fortunately, was air-conditioned. We then wanted to make the trip some use, so we decided to see the Gateway. It was fun and we saw a lot of couples there. We also returned by foot and had atleast a four km walk. As we returned by a fast train, there was tremendous rush at Andheri and Nitin got his lip swollen. We had had enough of the day and went to Powai in an air-conditioned bus. There were two wonderful girls in the bus. We had dinner in the restaurant in the campus and returned back to the hostel. We had set out to explore Mumbai but Mumbai ended up exploring us.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we got up at 9 in the morning and hurried without breakfast for fear that we were late. The lab was closed. We successfully installed FC5 on the computer by using the CD-ROM of another computer. We also installed the MySQL libraries for C and Java and tested the code of the laptop on the PC. It was working fine. We came to know that we were allowed 24-hours access to the department lab with AC. It had Windows and Linux. For surfing the internet, we have to ask for permission from Prof T. S. Rathore. Ladki kal bhagi thi aaj bhi nahi aayi.We got a hostel room H4-332 which was very dirty and without a tubelight. We asked for one more room.]]></content>

We surfed the internet for two hours in the afternoon and searched for an appropriate ADC for our project, though we didn’t come to any satisfactory conclusion. We also collected the ID cards in the evening. The day was cool but we didn’t do any work. We were sleepy in the afternoon. ladki bhaag gayi. We discussed about a diode resistor circuit solver in C in the evening. We upgraded the computer’s RAM to 256MB.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we successfully made JAVA query MySql!!! At last… Solanki Ma’am (the office person in the academic section) finally came back from her holiday (which delayed us by 10 days). We got the project form signed from the Dean which opened many doors for us -&gt; We were able to pay the project fees (Rs. 2000/- each). The fees reciept enabled us to step inside the department lab. We applied for hostel accomodation and identity card.We went to the department and met our project supervisor Mr. Uday Pandit after one whole week. We recieved our computer in the department today although we wont be allowed to work on it (i.e. install FC5 on it (rape it)) until some kind of permission is obtained from some computer supervisor. We also recieved our equipment today. From tomorrow we have to report at the department at 10 am(!!) everyday(!!!!) and brief the professor about our progress(??) before leaving. After coming back we watched Gangster (in a Body’s room coz our friend’s had locked the doors behind us). Before leaving in the afternoon I was at the brink of making Java work with MySql… I had the code… I had installed the package.. the code complied.. everything was perfect! BUT.. the code refused to work. Now at 2:30 am at night I realised I was trying to execute the wrong executable all along! Everything was perfect and the correct executable worked. I was just trying to execute the wrong one. Tomorrow we would be recieving our hostel accomodition. We will apply for sharda accounts (Sharda is the name of the mail server of the electrical department at IITB). Finally… the project starts.. Sahil]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Interfacing with C]]></title>
    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Finterfacing-with-c%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we interfaced C with MySQL successfully (even though we got up at 12 in the afternoon). We haven’t been able to contact Prof. T. S. Rathore and Mrs. Solanki was absent the whole week, due to which we are working in two teams, Sahil in H13 on Rohan’s comp and Sumit and me in H4 on my laptop. I had put the mysql.h file in /usr/include which was not the proper way of doing it, so Sahil downloaded the rpm from the internet and it worked like magic! Sahil is reading Java (it’s quite vast), I’m Orkutting and Blogging and Sumit is sleeping. We have read the Parapin tutorial and understood quite a lot of it. We’ll test it as soon as we lay our hands on the department comp (my laptop doesn’t have a parallel port). Sahil is reading about interfacing, packaging and threading. He says we have to read the whole of Java for implementing the plotting applet. Softwares: Fedore Core 5 phpMyAdmin 2.8 MySQL 5.0.18 libgcj-4.1.0 gcc 4.1.0 Parapin 1.0.0 Firefox 1.5.0.1 We are using only Open Source softwares for the development of our project. Have done: Understood Parapin programming in C through the Parapin library. Interfaced C and MySQL.To Do: To build the ADC and buffer circuit and clock it using Parapin. Test the C program real time using a variable dc input. Test the C program real time using a variable frequency ac input. Decrease the time delay in inserting data into the MySQL database. Understand Java applet programming. Interface Java with MySQL. Synchronize Java so that MySQL table is not flooded. Nitin Isloorkar]]></content>

    <url>%2Fpost%2F2006%2Fhere-is-a-way-to-search-great-things-through-google%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I got it from here. First of all, what’s an unprotected web directory? It’s one that does not have an “index” file created for it–index.htm, index.html, index.php or some other more rarely used file types. If you try to access a non-password controlled directory that does not have an index file, the system will build a listing of files that are within the directory. If you get that, you can then click on the files and run them with a viewer or player or even download them. So, for starters here is a query that will give you a search results page of unprotected directories: -inurl(html|htm|php) intitle:”index of” +”last modified” +”parent directory” +description +size But, this is kind of boring. Too many unknown program files, text files, web pages etc. Let’s narrow it down. You can narrow it down by looking for something in the name of a file in the list, or by the file type, or both. For example, this query tries to find any types of files about Jennifer Lopez. Within the directories I found music, image and movie files. -inurl(html|htm|php) intitle:”index of” +”last modified” +”parent directory” +description +size +”jennifer lopez” Let’s say that we wanted to find any movie files in WMV or AVI format: -inurl:(htm|html|php) intitle:”index of” +”last modified” +”parent directory” +description +size +(wmv|avi) You can get more specific by specifying both the file types and a search word to hopefully find in the name. For example, the following will attempt to find the infamous Paris Hilton video tape: -inurl:(htm|html|php) intitle:”index of” +”last modified” +”parent directory” +description +size +(wmv|avi) “paris hilton” Or, you can even take a guess at the file name someone might call it: -inurl:(htm|html|php) intitle:”index of” +”last modified” +”parent directory” +description +size +(”paris_hilton.wmv”|”paris_hilton.avi”) So there you go. You can combine various search terms and experiment with this. As you’ve seen, this is not an exact science. The directory pages you bring up may have many or even all files which are unrelated to what you are looking for. But, it does make some good hits very often. &quot;parent directory &quot;Xvid -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums]]></content>
